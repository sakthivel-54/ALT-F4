/*
 * Standalone Solar System build.
 *
 * A different product for a different audience than the main app: no satellite catalog, no
 * sensors, no conjunctions. What ships is the solar system itself - the Sun, the planets and
 * their rings and atmospheres, every major moon, the dwarf planets, the big four asteroids,
 * the procedural belt, and the five interstellar probes - plus the time controls needed to
 * watch any of it move.
 *
 * The catalog is the single biggest cost in this app (~25k objects plus three crunchers), and
 * nothing here reads it, so `noCatalogOnLoad` is what makes this boot in a couple of seconds
 * instead of twelve. Stars still load: keeptrack.ts routes an empty boot through
 * CatalogLoader.parse({}), which still adds stars, sensors and planets.

   * Always-enabled infra (SelectSatManager, Telemetry) is exempt and stays on.
